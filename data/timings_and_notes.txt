6/24 detectability:
10:55 started 500ppm flow
at some point between made some adjustments, I didn't write down exactly what, mainly trying to purge.
13:18 started 500ppm flow
13:58 started furnace 350C
15:03 turned off furnace, switched to 2sccm argon flow

6/25 detectability:
11:04 started daq
11:35 started 500ppm flow
12:07 turned furnace on to 400C
13:58 increased furnace to 500C
16:02 decreased flow to 10sccm argon, decreased furnace to 150C

6/26 detectability:
11:05 started daq
11:55 investigated hydrogen traps -> turned out the g2 traps still had a lot of hydrogen, but the g1 traps and the cell didn't, so bypassed the traps for this detectability
12:41 flowing 500ppm @ 5psi through valve 11
13:17 turned furnace from 150C -> 600C
15:05 increased from P~4.5psi to P~21.5psi
16:20 turned off furnace, flow down to 2sccm

6/27 dry run: 
11:00 started daq
11:13 furnace to 600C, argon P=10psi
~11:40 seeing what I think is a nitrogen peak swelling, but then decreases around a half hour later
12:07 nturned on hydrogen, ~15 seconds to 50psi
~13:30 slightly adjusted BPreg
~15:00 again adjusted BPreg, dP around 5psi
15:47 furned off hydrogen flow, furnace still on

6/28 dry run:
11:30 started daq
11:50 turned on hydrogen -> P_H2 = 45psi, dP = 2psi, P_Ar = 10psi, flow = 20sccm, T = 600C
16:42 turned off H2, furnace, and lowered argo to 5scccm
